This is a simple locally-hosted Flask app for managing tasks.
It uses the OpenAI API to turn freeform natural-language user input into structured tasks -> saves them to a local database ~~-> syncs them with Google Calendar (if linked)~~ (not implemented yet, ~ december) 

 
## Deployment and Architecture:

- Containerized with Docker
- Reverse proxied through Cloudflare using [Cloudflared](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/)
- UI auto-switches between mobile and desktop based on User-Agent headers
